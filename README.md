This repository contains the content for the
[Betterbox.es](http://betterbox.es) website, a 
well-organized list of third party base boxes for the lovely Vagrant
virtualisation tool.

The intent behind placing the code here is to facilitate discussion of
the proposed versioning scheme and other ways to improve the sharing
of base boxes.

It builds on the great work of Gareth Rushgrove's
[Vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantboxes.com).
